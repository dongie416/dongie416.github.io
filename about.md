	<h2>Basic Knowledge</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>  It’s not a one-game-fits-all sport. </li>
			<ol> Unlike the NFL or MLB where athletes play a single sport with set rules, eSports athletes compete in a variety of game types. MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) games like League of Legends and Dota 2, and FPS (first-person shooter) games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), Call of Duty, and Halo are some of the most popular games to play professionally. Yet almost any game where players compete can become an eSports game. Strategy games like StarCraft II and Hearthstone are also gamer favorites. </ol>
		<li> Players are a lot like traditional athletes. </li>
			<ol> Sure, they’re not scoring on astroturf end zones or shooting hoops from shiny basketball courts, but eSports players are more like traditional athletes than you think. Like baseball players, they spend hours each day practicing their craft both on their own and as a team. Hockey players might watch footage from their opponent’s past games; eSports broadcasters study other teams’ strategies and formulate “plays” and methodologies to defeat them. </ol>
