<h2> If we know what an Circumcenter is, how can we create one? </h2>
<li> Gather Materials: Straightedge or ruler, a compass and a pencil. </li>
<li> With those gathered materials, draw a perpendicular bisector of each side.
<ol> How to create a perpendicular bisector
<ol> 1st, measure with your compass, in a segment, longer than half of that segment and draw an arc each side, over and under the segment and do the same, putting the sharp edge of your compass on the other point of the segment. </ol>
<ol> 2nd, with the intersecting points of 2 pairs of arcs, connect them through the side of the triangle, resulting in a perpendicular bisector.<ol>
</ol>
</li>
<li> With all the perpendicular bisectors, create the point of intersection / concurrency, which concludes in the Circumcenter!! </li>
