<h3> What makes up an Incenter? </h3>
<p> The element that creates an incenter throughout the triangle is called the angle bisector. The key importance about the angle bisector of the Incenter is that the three angle bisectors based on the vertexes, meet at their own point of concurrency, which now is named the Incenter. Throughout the Incenter, the perpendicular lines that go through the incenter and each sides are equidistant with each other, due to the fact that it is the radius of the circle.</p>
