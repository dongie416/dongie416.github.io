<h3> What makes up an orthocenter? </h3>
<p> An Altitude, in geometry, is a line segment that goes through a specific vertex of a triangle, and something unique about this line, is that it is perpendicular towards the facing side of the triangle.</p>

<p> An orthocenter is the point where all altitudes meet or intersect with each other within a triangle. Another word for the point of intersection is called the point of concurrency. The three altitudes that are in the triangle are always concurrent, meaning that they always meet at a certain point, with no importance of whether if its inside or outside. </p>
