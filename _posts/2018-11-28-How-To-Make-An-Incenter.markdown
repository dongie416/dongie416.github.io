<h2> If we know what an Incenter is, how can we create one? </h2>
<li>Step 1. Gather materials, a compass and a straightedge, or a ruler. </li>
<li>Step 2. Using the compass create an arc in order to show an angle for each vertex. </li>
<li>Step 3. Utilizing the point of intersection that the arc has created, measure the two point of intersection with your compass.</li>
<li>Step 4. With the measured distance with your compass, create 4 arcs. For example, for the left side = an arc on top and an arc on the bottom, for the right side = an arc on top and an arc on the bottom. </li>
<li>Step 5. Wherever the two pairs of arcs meet, connect the two point of intersection of the 2 pairs of arcs -> the line that connects the two point of intersection should go through the angle creating an angle bisector. </li>
<li> P.S. (Suggestion) You should make your angle bisector longer so that it is more visible where your incenter is, â˜…remember that an incenter cannot be outside the triangle! </li>
