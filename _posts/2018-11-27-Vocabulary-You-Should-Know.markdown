<h3> For this webpage you should contain some knowledge of some of these vocabularies </h3>
<ol> Angle bisector -> A line segment that splits a specific angle in half identically.</ol>
<ol> Perpendicular bisector  -> A line segment that splits the line segment into two identically, also created a 90 degree angle, becoming a perpendicular (90 degree) and a bisector (splitting the segment in half) </ol>
<ol> Altitude -> A line segment that goes through both a triangle vertex and one of its sides, however, when it intersect with one of the side, it creates a 90 degree angle, becoming a perpendicular line rather than a bisector </ol>
<ol> Medians -> A line segment that connects the vertex and its facing side, also bisecting the side.</ol>
<ol> Incenter -> A triangle center that is created by using angle bisectors. Finding the point of intersection or concurrency of the angle bisectors results in the Incenter. (Always inside the triangle) </ol>
<ol> Circumcenter -> A triangle center that is found by finding the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of each side of the triangle. (Right triangle - On the hypotenuse of the triangle) (Acute Triangle - Inside the triangle) (Obtuse Triangle - Outside the triangle.) </ol>
<ol> Orthocenter -> A triangle center that is found by finding the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle that go through each vertex. (Right triangle - On the right angle) (Acute Triangle - Inside the triangle) (Obtuse triangle - Outside the triangle)
<ol> Centroid -> A triangle center that is found by discovering the intersection of the medians of the triangle that connects with each vertex of the triangle. (Always in the Triangle.) </ol>
