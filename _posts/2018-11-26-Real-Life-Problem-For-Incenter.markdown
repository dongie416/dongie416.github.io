<h2> How can we apply an Incenter in Real Life? </h2>
<p> For this real life application, we have 3 different distances that exists in Korea the photo. The first location is my house which is Parkview, located in Bundang-Gu, the second location is named Jamsil-SongPa-Gu, located in Seoul. Finally the last location is Yangjae-Dong and in the points F, J and K, exists a single person who are friends with each other. Points C, D and E are their houses, which does not matter with the issue that they're having however, it creates the triangle and the incenter of △CDE. The three friends have been arguing for a few minutes that their meeting point is too far from their current location. So they decide to meet at the incenter of the triangle because the point they´re at currently are the perpendicular lines that pass through the incenter which are equidistant to each other.</p>
