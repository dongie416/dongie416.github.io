<h2> How can we apply an Incenter in Real Life? </h2>
<p> For example, John is in a cycling match with other people, in which of course he wants to win first place. His mother has come to watch the game, however, since its her son, she wants to watch his son the whole race during the entire 90 minutes. So she decides to choose a seat that is the center of the whole track in order to be able to see her son cycling. Nevertheless, she becomes confused, not knowing which seat to choose due to the fact that she does not know the center of the track. She creates a diagram in order to get the center of the track, trying to find the Circumcenter. </p>
