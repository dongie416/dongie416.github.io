<h2> About some shoes </h2>
<h3> No. 1 - Yeezys </h3>
<h4> What are Yeezys? </h4>
<ul> Yeezys refers to adidas (or Nike) sneakers designed in collaboration with Kanye West. Originally, Kanye had partnered with Nike, but the rapper split with Nike in 2014 due to a royalty dispute and him wanting to have more creative control over the design.

Since joining adidas, Kanye has served as chief designer for the sneaker. This collaboration, for example, is different than most athlete/celebrity and shoe company partnerships, because West has almost complete creative control in the design process.

For adidas, West designs clothing and sneakers, which are released under the umbrella of the Yeezy Supply label. West has complete creative control. West created the unique Yeezy silhouettes, chose the bold colorways, and signed off on other unique materials.

People have taken notice too. The latest Yeezy sneakers — Yeezy BOOST 350 and 350 Boost v2 — have been praised for their unique design. Featuring unique knit-top patterns and bold, yet simple colorways, the Yeezys may be the most fashionable running shoe in the world. They’ve even inspired imitators. For example, Steve Madden’s Baldwin sneakers share a striking resemblance to the BOOST 350 line-up.

Since partnering with adidas, the Yeezy sneakers’ design has become much more minimalistic. Nike Air Yeezy collaborations, for instance, like the ultra-rare Red Octobers, feature many pieces, intricate design work, and bespoke appointments. The Boost 350 and Boost 750, though, have more classic colorways, and a pared down design aesthetic.</ul>

<h3> No. 2 Off White </h3>
<h4> What is Off-White? </h4>
<ul> Virgil Abloh and Nike’s “The Ten” collaboration was the biggest sneaker release event of 2017, and Highsnobiety readers voted Abloh the most influential person of 2017, also electing his Nike Air Jordan 1 “Chicago” design as the best sneaker of 2017 in the annual Highsnobiety Crowns awards.

In an unprecedented move, “The Ten” included sneakers from Nike, as well as Nike-owned brands Converse and Jordan. Held from late October to early November 2017, the first release was split into two packs of five, and each silhouette ties back to Nike’s two big claims to fame – running and basketball. In the “REVEALING” pack, we find the Air Jordan I, Nike Air Max 90, Nike Air Presto, Nike Air VaporMax and Nike Blazer Mid. The supplementary “GHOSTING” pack included a Nike Air Max 97, React Hyperdunk, Air Force 1, Zoom Vaporfly, and Chuck Taylor All-Star.

Abloh himself spoke about “The Ten” by saying, “It’s larger than design culture. These 10 shoes have broken barriers in performance and style. To me, they are on the same level as a sculpture of David or the Mona. You can debate it all you want, but they mean something. And that’s what’s important.”

The collaboration was teased on Instagram months ahead of its release, leaving sneakerheads hotly anticipating the release date of the deconstructed kicks, after they were heavily co-signed on social media by some of the biggest musicians and celebrities in the industry, including A$AP Rocky, Drake, even Kim Jones and Naomi Campbell. </ul>
